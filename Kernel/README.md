# Kernel


Simple kernel that shows the logo and executes a scuffed shell. I surprised myself with the shell because it "works" and isn't really that terrible. The shell supports attributes and for now has these commands: help, clear, ls, fetch, reboot, himom and edit. There's a VGA driver and some setup code for a VESA one, that will be used when possible, because with VESA we can use higher resolutions and way more colours.
